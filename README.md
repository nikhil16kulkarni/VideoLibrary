# VideoLibrary

An Android Application developed using RestAPI.

This Application accesses a [JSON File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bikashthapa01/myvideos-android-app/master/data.json) for displaying all the information of the videos such as Title, Author, Description, URL of the Image to be displayed & the URL of the Video itself. 

In the Home Page, the Title & the Image of all the JSON Objects which are stored in a list are displayed using Recycler View. Currently, the Source, Views & the Upload Date of the Video is the same but can be modified. If we click on the particular Item, a Spinner is displayed till the video is completely loaded & the video will start playing. Below the video, Title & the Description of the Video is present. At the top right corner of the video, there is option to watch the video in a Full Screen. After clicking the Full Screen button, the orientation of the Screen changes to Landscape & a new button to exit from Full Screen is displayed. After clicking on that button, the orientation of the screen again changes to Portrait.
